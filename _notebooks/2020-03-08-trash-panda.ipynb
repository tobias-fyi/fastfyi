    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "You have an object in your hand that you intend to throw away. When you think about it as you're walking to the bins, you realize you actually don't know whether this type of object is recyclable or not. Maybe it is made of multiple different materials, or of an uncommon or unrecognizable material.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're in the middle of an important project, and it's crunch time—no extra time available to spend researching. You end up throwing it in the recycling because it...well, it _seems_ like something that would be recyclable. With the decision made and action taken, you return to your important project, forgetting all about what just transpired.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd bet that most who are reading this have had an experience like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The priceless time and energy spent researching how to properly dispose of every single item can add up. However, the US is in something of a recycling crisis at the moment, partially due to the low quality of our recyclable waste—it tends to be very intermixed with non-recyclables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ever since China's [National Sword](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/national-sword/) legislation in 2017, which vastly reduced the amount of foreign recycling—particularly low-quality—the country would accept, recycling companies in the US have been forced to grapple with this quality issue. The cost of recycling increases when more trash is intermingled with it, as more sorting has to occur prior to processing. Whether it is more expensive machines or higher cost of labor, sorting costs money.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the domestic recycling infrastructure will (hopefully) grow to meet the increasing demand, the best way to solve a problem is to address the source of the issue, not the symptoms. One key reason for the low quality recycling is simply a lack of easily accessible information. Even with the power of modern search engines at our fingertips, finding relevant recycling information can take a long time, as what exactly constitutes recycling changes depending on area and company.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple fact is that most people don't want to spend the additional time it takes (at least up front) to have good recycling habits. So why not simply remove that additional time from the equation?"

    "### The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal was to build an app that helps to foster better recycling habits by reducing the the effort needed to find accurate and relevant information on how to properly dispose of any given item of waste. To make this possible, we needed to reduce the friction so much so that looking up how to dispose of something that a user is holding in their hand is just as quick and easy as debating for a few moments on what bin it goes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put another way, our goal was to reduce the cognitive tax of getting relevant recycling information so much that disposing of every item of waste properly, regardless of what it is, becomes effortless.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our stakeholder envisioned that the user would simply snap a photo of something they are about to toss. Then, the app's computer vision (object detection) functionality would recognize the object and automatically pull up the relevant information on how it should be disposed of according to the user's location and available services. The user would know immediately if the item should be thrown in the trash, recycle, or compost, or if it is recyclable only at an offsite facility. For the latter case, the user would be able to view a list of nearby facilities that accept the item or material.\n",
    "\n",

Google has been moving to fully support PWAs, meaning Trash Panda is available on the Play Store right now. Of course the benefit of a PWA is you don't actually have to download it at all if you don't want to. You can use it directly from the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apple is pretty far behind in their support of PWAs. As a result, the behavior on an iOS device is not ideal. For those on iOS, be sure to use Safari. And when taking a picture of an item, you have to exit out of the video window before pressing the normal shutter button.\n",

    "### The Team (and My Role On It)\n",
    "\n",
    "For eight weeks near the beginning of 2020, I worked with a remote interdisciplinary team to bring the vision of Trash Panda to life.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The Trash Panda Team](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tobias-fyi/assetstash/master/visual/images/trash_panda/trash-panda-team.png \"The Trash Panda Team\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Trash Panda is by far the most ambitious machine learning endeavor I had yet embarked on. Indeed, it was the largest software project I'd worked on in just about every respect: time, team, ambition, breadth of required knowledge. As such, it provided to me many valuable, foundational experiences that I'll surely keep with me throughout my entire career.\n",
    "\n",
    "I seriously lucked out on the team for this project. Every single one of them was hard-working, thoughtful, friendly—a pleasure to work with. [The team](https://thetrashpanda.com/splash/team) included myself and three other machine learning engineers, four web developers, and two UX designers (links to all of their respective sites in the Final Thoughts section below). Our stakeholder Trevor Clack, who came up with the idea for the app and [pitched it](https://youtu.be/oVh8fccQHZQ) to Labs, also worked on the project as a machine learning engineer.\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Trevor's Trash Panda blog post](https://tclack88.github.io/blog/personal/2020/03/07/trash-panda.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "We all pushed ourselves throughout each and every day of the eight weeks to make Trevor's vision come to life, learning entirely new technologies, frameworks, skills, and processes along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the web developers taught themselves how to use GraphQL, along with a variety of related/dependent technology. On the machine learning side of things, none of us had significant applied experience with computer vision (CV) going into the project. We'd spent a few days studying and working with it in the Deep Learning unit of our Lambda School curriculum. But that was more to expose us to it, rather than covering the entire process in-depth. We had only the shallowest of surface scratches compared to what was ultimately needed to meet the vision set out for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the machine learning engineers on the team, we were responsible for the entire process of getting an object detection system built, trained, deployed, and integrated with the app. Basically, we were starting from scratch, both in the sense of a greenfield project and of us being inexperienced with CV.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, CV is still machine learning—many steps in the process are similar to any other supervised machine learning project. But working with images comes with its own suite of unique challenges that we had to learn how to overcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "We split up the work as evenly as possible, given our initially limited knowledge of the details, with some steps being split up between some or all of us, and other steps having a sole owner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step for which I was solely responsible included building a system to automatically remove the background from images (or extract the foreground, depending on how you look at it). Essentially, when tasked with figuring out a way to automate the process of removing the background from images so they could be auto-labeled via a script written by Trevor, I built a secondary pipeline with a pre-trained image segmentation model. More details can be found in the Automated Background Removal section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, I was responsible for building and deploying the object detection API. I built the API using Flask, containerized it with Docker, and deployed it to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. I go into a little more detail in the Deployment section below, though I will be digging into the code and process of the API much more in a separate blog post.\n",
    "\n",
    "All members of the machine learning team contributed to the gathering and labeling of the dataset. To this end, each of us ended up gathering and labeling somewhere in the range of 20,000 images, for a total of over 82,000."

    "### Classifications\n",
    "\n",
    "As also seems to be the case with most, if not all, projects in general, we were almost constantly grappling with scope management. In an ideal world, our model would be able to recognize any object that anyone would ever want to throw away. But in reality is this is practically impossible, particularly within the 8 weeks we had to work on Trash Panda. I say \"practically\" because I'm sure if a company dedicated enough resources to the problem, eventually it could be solved, at least to some degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we were granted an API key from [Earth911](https://earth911.com/) (shoutout to them for helping out!) to utilize their [recycling center search database](https://search.earth911.com/). At the time we were working with it, the database held information on around 300 items—how they should be recycled based on location, and facilities that accept them if they are not curbside recyclable. They added a number of items when we were already most of the way done with the project, and have likely added more since then.\n",
    "\n",
    "We had our starting point for the list of items our system should be able to recognize. However, the documentation for the neural network architecture we'd decided to use suggested that to create a robust model, it should be trained with at least 1,000 instances (in this case, images) of each of the classes we wanted it to detect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gathering 300,000 images was also quite a bit out of the scope of the project at that point. So, the DS team spent many hours reducing the size of that list to something a little more manageable and realistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main method of doing so was to group the items based primarily on visual similarity. We knew it was also out of the scope of our time with the project to train a model that could tell the difference between #2 plastic bottles and #3 plastic bottles, or motor oil bottles and brake fluid bottles.\n",

    "\n",
    "Given enough time and resources, who knows? Maybe we could train a model that accurately recognizes 300+ items and distinguishes between similar-looking items. But we had to keep our scope realistic to be sure that we actually finished something useful in the time we had.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also considered the items that 1) users would be throwing away on a somewhat regular basis, and 2) users would usually either be unsure of how to dispose of properly or would dispose of properly. More accuracy on the important and/or common items would be more valuable to users. Some items were not grouped. \n",

    "\n",
    "As explained below, the image gathering step required significant manual labor. However, we had a plan in place for automating most of the rest of the process. Below is a general outline of the image processing and labeling pipeline we built.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rename the images to their md5sum hash to avoid duplicates and ensure unique filenames\n",

    "\n",
    "The gathering process was a mixture of downloading and sifting. As we were pulling images straight from the internet, irrelevant images inevitably found their way into the search queries somehow. For each class, we went through a iterative (and somewhat tedious) loop until we had around 1,000 images of that class. The steps were simple, yet time-consuming:\n",

The highest quality results came from creating a batch task in Adobe Photoshop, as whatever algorithm powers its \"Select Foreground\" functionality is very consistent and accurate. However, we could not use this method because it could not be added to the pipeline—I was the only one with a license, meaning the speed of my computer and internet could cause a major bottleneck.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method I tested out was the OpenCV implementation of an algorithm called [GrabCut](https://www.docs.opencv.org/trunk/d8/d83/tutorial_py_grabcut.html). Long story short, I wasn't able to get the quality we needed from it, as can be seen below.\n",

This would've made the output mask much more accurate and reduced the time spent fixing the labels afterwards.\n",

    "### Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to utilize our hard-earned trained weights for inference in the app, I built an object detection API with Flask and used Docker to deploy it to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trained weights were loaded into a live network using OpenCV, which can then be used for inference (prediction; detecting objects). Once a user takes a photo in the app, it is encoded and sent to the detection API. The API decodes the image and passes it into the live network running with the trained weights. The network runs inference on the image and sends back the class of item with the highest predicted probability.\n",

    "### Potential Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we had eight weeks for this project, we were starting with a completely green field. Therefore, at least the first two weeks were dedicated to discussions and planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of scope management is features and ideas left unimplemented. At the beginning, the entire team brainstormed a lot about potential ideas for the app. And throughout the project, the machine learning team was always thinking and discussing potential improvements. Here is a brief summary of some of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and most obvious one is to simply expand the model by gathering and labeling an even wider variety and even greater numbers of images. By breaking out the grouped items into more specific classes and gathering more images, the model could be trained to distinguish between some of the visually similar (though materially different) objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, there are some low-hanging fruit that would likely make the model more robust. One of those that we did not get to explore due to lack of time is image augmentation. In a nutshell, image augmentation is a method of artificially growing an image dataset by \"creating\" new images from the existing ones by transforming or otherwise manipulating them.\n",
    "\n",
    "These augmentations could include changing the color, crop, skew, rotation, and even combining multiple images. The labels are also transformed to match the location and size of the transformed objects in each image. Not only does this process help create more training data, but it can also help the model extract more of the underlying features of the objects, allowing it to be more robust to a greater variety of lighting conditions and camera angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to increase the size and variety of the dataset would be to add a feature that gathers the images (and labels) taken by the user. After every prediction that is served, the user could be presented with a box containing two buttons, one indicating that the prediction was correct, the other, incorrect. The correct ones could go straight to the server to wait until the next model training round. And if the user indicates that the predicted class was incorrect, they could be presented with an interface to draw a box around the object and choose the correct class. Then that image and label would be sent to the server to be used in training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last idea was one that the entire team discussed at one point, though is a feature that would likely only be possible with some kind of financial backing. The idea is to implement a system that recognizes when many of a similar type of object are detected—those need to be recycled at the same facility, for example—and can pay drivers to pick all of those items up and take them to the proper facilities. In other words, be the \"UBER for recycling\"."
